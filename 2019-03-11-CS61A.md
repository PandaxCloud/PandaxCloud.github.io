An expression describes a computation and evaluates to a value.

All expressions can use function call notation.

Operators and operands are also expressions, so they evaluate to values.

**Evaluation procedure for call expressions:**

1. Evaluate the operator and then the operand subexpressions.

2. Apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpression to
the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpression.

**Execution rule for assignment statements:**

1. Evaluate all expressions to the right of = from left to right.

2. Bind all names to the left of = to those resulting values in the current frame.

Assignment is a simple means of abstraction: binds names to values;

Function definition is a more powerful means of abstraction: binds names to expressions.

**Execution procedure for def statements:**

1. Create a function with signature <name>(<formal parameters>).

2. Set the body of that function to be everything indented after the first line.

3. Bind <name> to that function in the current frame.

Every expression is evaluated in the context of an environment.

An environment is a sequence of frames.

A name evaluates to the value bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment in which that name is found.

**Procedure for calling/applying user-defined functions (version 1):**

1. Add a local frame, forming a new environment.

2. Bind the function's formal parameters to its arguments in that frame.

3. Execute the body of the function in that new environment.

A function’s signature has all the information needed to create a local frame。
